Creating a Node projectðŸ¥³ðŸ‘¾
* STEP ONE: Create your project!
    mkdir node-proj
* STEP TWO: Enter your project folder
    cd into your node-proj
* STEP THREE: Fill out the info or skip through it
    npm init -y
* STEP FOUR: Create your index.js or other files
    touch index.js, touch myModule.js, touch story.txt, etc.
    index.js could be your entry point file
* Node packages are already written modules developed by someone else.
    nodemon is a type of package that restarts the node application everytime you hit save.
    -g saves a package globally rather than locally.
* You should create a hidden file called .gitignore in order to avoid pushing unecessary items up to github
